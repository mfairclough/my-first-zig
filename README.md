# Baby steps in Zig Lang and Mach Core.

This is based on a getting-started example at https://machengine.org/

Added zmath dependency (as a submodule). Original zmath is https://github.com/michal-z/zig-gamedev/tree/main/libs/zmath but this project is using the fork at https://github.com/machlibs/zmath

*Don't follow my example, because I'm a complete beginner in Zig.*
